<h2 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16px;">Soon To Be A Lot Of Out-Of-Work Comedians</h2>

<p>We've all seen them, those terrible comics who coast by boring middle-aged audiences by pointing out all of the "hilarious" ways that men and women are different. Some of them even post about it on <?= HTML::anchor('http://www.swurve.com/', 'Casual Dating Site'); ?>!  <i>Women always interrupt my sports! Men never put the toilet seat down!</i> These have been the basis for a depressingly large percentage of comedian's bits over the span of time (yes, cavemen left the toilet seat up too). But fortunately, these crap comics may be out of work soon.</p>

<p>A report to be published this month in the <strong><i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i></strong> found that men and women are not split decisively in categories ranging from "empathy and sexuality to science inclination and extroversion." Harry Reis, professor of psychology at the University of Rochester, and Bobbi Carothers, a senior data analyst for the Center for Public Health System Science at Washington University in St. Louis, analyzed data on 122 various characteristics of 13,301 individuals. That is a ridiculously large sample, which lends a great deal of credibility to the study's findings.</p>

<p>Bad comedians aren't the only ones guilty of unfairly stereotyping men and women, Reis and Carothers identified 13 studies that "had shown significant, and often large, sex differences," and reanalyzed them. They found that men and women were divided in certain physical attributes (height, shoulder breadth, arm circumference, hip-to-waist ratio), as well as extremely gendered activities like "scrapbooking and cosmetics (women) and boxing and watching pornography (men)." But outside of these few categories, the sex difference was negligible.</p>

<p>According to Reis, belief in gender stereotypes often is a source of friction in relationships, as it can blur what makes one's partner an individual. In fact, what tends to be the source of friction is a complicated disconnect between large numbers of varying characteristics. If gender differences were the basis of relationship discord, then we would see no arguments amongst gay and lesbian couples; anyone with close gay and lesbian friends knows this simply isn't the case.</p>

<p>My advice? Learn to appreciate the physical differences as well as the similiarities between males and females. We all want the same things: life, liberty, happiness, and hand jobs.</p>
