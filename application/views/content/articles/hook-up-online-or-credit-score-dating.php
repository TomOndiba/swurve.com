<h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Hook Up Online or Date Based On Credit Score?</h1>

<p>These days everyone is trying to figure out who is right for them and who isn't right for them before they even meet a person in real life.</p>
<p>That's natural - we don't want to get screwed over before we even get screwed! It's something humans have always had within us since we were cave people. We don't want to put ourselves into danger when we can avoid it and spend time isolated in our caves.</p>
<p>But lately - things have gone a little out of control.</p>
<p>You may have heard all the rage about Dating Based On Credit Score lately. Articles and TV News programs are promoting it as being 'The Next Big Thing' when it comes to Hooking Up Online.</p>
<p>Well, it isn't.</p>
<p>Personally we find it very disturbing that you would base a potential relationship with someone on something as trivial and fickle as a credit score.</p>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">You know who has a bad credit score? Here are a list of people who you supposedly shouldn't Date Based On Credit Score:</h2>

<p>1. <strong>Doctors</strong> - Tons of outstanding student loan debt that takes forever to pay off. Dating a doctor, however, pays off right away.<br />
2. <strong>Police Officers</strong> - Police Academy costs a LOT of money, yet cops end up making a great HONEST living!<br />
3. <strong>Veteranarians</strong> - Yes, your cat's nurse had to pay a lot to get her degree, and though it cost him/her a ton of money the job itself doesn't pay great right away, and that can mean defaulted student loans if they're overworked and do not have a ton of time to manage their personal resources!<br />
4. <strong>Teachers</strong> - Teachers have infamously bad credit histories. They go to school for over half a decade so that they can earn less than many manual labor jobs. Teachers in America are some of the most amazing, positive, loving people there are - yet according to this new trend you supposedly shouldn't date them.</p>

<p><strong>Whatever.</strong></p>

<p>In short, do not listen to these critics who think that the sign of a good relationship is your partner being financially successful.
Money isn't everything.</p>
