<h1>5 Ways To Be A Better Boyfriend</h1>
<p>Okay, so you've been active in <?= HTML::anchor('http://www.swurve.com/', 'online dating sites'); ?> for a while now and you're looking to get more than hook-ups (you're a better man than me). Here are some tips to get yourself paired up long-term. I'm not suggesting that you change who you are, but these tips are good for you too; so even if you're Don Juan, consider reading and better yourself.<br /><br /><p>


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;">1. Get Away From The Boob (Tube)</h2>
<p>A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine showed a link between bad boob tube habits and lowered sperm count. According to the paper, men who watched more than 20 hours of television per week had a 44 percent lower sperm count than men with more moderate TV watching habits. Though, if children aren't in the cards for your current relationship, get your dude hooked on Breaking Bad or The Wire; that will knock his sperm count way down! I don't need a study to tell me that when a guy has been on a Netflix Instant binge, he's far less likely to get laid.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;">2. Be More European, Work Less</h2>
<p>We all know that working less leads to less stress (until credit card bills are due), but a report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research adds a new motivation for being channeling your inner slacker. The 13 page report states that although "some amount of climate change is inevitable . . . choosing a more European response to productivity gains rather than following a model more like that of the United States [could significantly reduce climate change]." I'm not telling you to run out and get a European boyfriend (that's a little too 1990s), but if you could get the hardworking jerk you're with to work less, we'd all be in better shape.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;">3. Don't Be A Smoker/Insane</h2>
<p>31% of all cigarettes are smoked by adults with mental illness, according to a report out today from the Centers for Disease Control. While this doesn't necessarily mean that if your man is a smoker he's also a joker, there is a link between the two and besides, making out with a smoker is a lot like licking an ashtray my girlfriends tell me all the time.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;">4. Be Old, Like Really Old</h2>
<p>From JAMA Internal Medicine, comes research that Baby Boomers are less healthy than their parents (the generation of Americans born between 1946 and 1964). While Boomers have a longer life expectancy, they have higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, obesity and high cholesterol. So when out looking for a sugar daddy, think more like Anna Nicole Smith and less like Demi Moore.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;">5. Go To The Beach</h2>
<p>This might sound like pandering to those who live in the Northeast, but a healthy amount of sun is necessary for Vitamin D production. You might be thinking, "Oh, I get plenty of Vitamin D from milk." While there is D in cow's milk, there is only 100 IU per glass; whereas the Recommended Daily Allowance is 600 IU for people Ages 1-70 (800 IU for ages 71+). You would need to be drinking 6 cups of milk every day to get what you need D-wise. So, readers in the South, get outside; readers in the North, get William Shatner on the case finding you a sunny destination.<br /><br /></p>

<p>So there you have it; I'm burning my TV, moving to France, quitting smoking and hanging out on the beach all day. Oh and I'm getting older as we speak. Thank god I can find other people like me, well, if I spend enough time on some <?= HTML::anchor('http://www.swurve.com/user/register', 'Online Dating Sites'); ?>.</p>
