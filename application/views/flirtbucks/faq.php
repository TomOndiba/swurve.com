<h1>Flirtbucks FAQ</h1>

<h3>What do I need to get started?</h3>
 
<p>If you're a woman over the age of 18 the only tools you need to start making money are access to a computer with a working webcam and a high speed internet connection. For a full list of requirements please refer to our requirements page.</p>
 
<h3>When and How do I get paid?</h3>
 
<p>We pay out roughly every two weeks and make payments by both check and paypal. We have 2 pay periods per month- the first pay period runs from the 1st through the 15th and the second pay period runs from the 16th through the end of the month. Payments are usually completed within 5 business days after the pay period has ended.</p>
 
<h3>How much can I expect to make?</h3>
 
<p>As a chat hostess you can make as much or as little as you set your mind to earning. Some hostesses use the program as a great way to earn money on the side and some have made it their full time job. However you choose to approach the program you will earn money for every minute you are engaged with members in chat. The FlirtBucks platform allows for you to engage multiple users simultaneously so you can maximize your earning potential for the time you spend online. For a breakdown of rates per minute please visit our program page.</p>
 
<h3>What's the catch?</h3>
 
<p>There is absolutely no catch. It doesn't cost a dime to get started with FlirtBucks and you are under no obligation to continue with the program once you have begun earning. Once your application has been approved you can stop and start work at your discretion. </p>
 
<h3>Will I have to take my clothes off or talk dirty?</h3>
 
<p>No. This is not an adult cam performer program. Keep in mind this is a flirtatious chat service intended for adults and as such you can expect in the course of conversation from time to time adult subject matter will be approached. If you are sensitive to adult subject matter or content of a sexual nature this is not the program for you. That said, this is not a graphic service and hardcore adult actions are not permitted on cam. You are not at any time under any obligation to stay engaged in a chat session with a member or follow directives given by another user. You can close a chat session at any time for any reason. It is up to your sole discretion how naughty or nice you want to play.</p>
 
<h3>I'm not shy, so what do I need to do?</h3>
 
<p>All you have to do is be yourself and do what comes naturally. There are no scripts to follow or upsells to pitch, our program is about active participation. All you need to do is put your best foot forward, be engaging, be flirtatious and have fun! Apply today and see what FlirtBucks can do for you!</p>
