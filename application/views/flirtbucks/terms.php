<p><strong>COMMISSION</strong></p>
<p>Commissions generated through the Program via participation and use of pay per play features that allow a Chat Hostess to earn a per-minute rate as long as the paying user on the other end remains engaged. Commission is decided by a sliding scale / tiered commission plan which benefits program participants based on the amount of activity and length of time a Chat Hostess successfully remains active within the Program. These rates are published on the program page of FlirtBucks.net.</p>
<p>Payout amounts and available commission plans are subject to change. Should the company exercise its right to edit a commission plan changes shall take immediate effect. All pending commissions will not be recalculated and will remain unaltered. Commissions are earned on revenue generated by premium feature usage of the service only, other transactions customers may make through the service, its affiliates, or partners are not eligible to be included in the Program. Participants in the Program may be held liable for fraudulent transactions. Any commission earned from revenue that is entered into dispute by an issuing bank or cardholder will be deducted from the account balance.</p>

<p><strong>PAYOUTS</strong></p>
<p>Pay periods run from the 1st through the 15th and from the 16th to the end of each calendar month. Payouts are calculated and are due to be cut 5 business days from the close of the previous pay period. Payouts are made semi-monthly and occur bi-weekly on average. </p>
<p>If an account is flagged for suspicious or fraudulent activity payments may be held until an investigation can be completed and a resolution can be determined. Investigations are typically resolved in 2 weeks but can take up to 30 days. During that time any residual sales will be calculated and added to the pending commission on hold. At the conclusion pending commissions will either be released at the close of the following pay period or removed at the time of account termination depending on the result of the investigation.</p>

<p><strong>TAX POLICY</strong></p>
<p>All participants of the Program that are subject to U.S. taxes are responsible to report their earnings to the IRS. If your physical address on file with the Program is based within the United States we are required to have a completed W-9 form on file for your account.</p>
