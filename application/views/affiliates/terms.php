<p><b>COMMISSION</b></p>
<p>Commissions generated through “Pay Per Sale” plans allow
an affiliate to earn a one-time flat fee when a new premium membership is successfully
initiated by a user referred by an affiliate. Affiliates selecting Pay Per Sale
commission plans do not earn on revenue generated by recurring transactions. </p>

<p>Commissions generated through “Rev-Share” plans allow an
affiliate to earn a percentage of all revenue generated by membership fees of
users they have referred. Affiliates selecting Rev-share commission plans earn
a percentage of the initial sale as well as a percentage of all subsequent
successful recurring transactions that result from the referred user’s
membership.</p>

<p>Payout amounts and available commission plans are subject
to change. Affiliates may also switch their plans and payment options at any
time through the account controls available through the Program, by contacting
an account manager, or sending an email request to <a
href="mailto:affiliates@swurve.com">affiliates@swurve.com</a> .
The new plan will apply to all users referred to the site after the plan change
has been processed. Users of the Service who have been referred previous to
plan changes will not be transferred and will continue to generate commission
based on the plan that was active at the time of their referral. Should the
company exercise its right to edit a commission plan changes shall take
immediate effect. All pending commissions will not be recalculated and will
remain unaltered Commissions are earned on revenue generated by membership fees
paid to access the service only, other transactions customers may make through
the service, its affiliates, or partners are not eligible to be included in the
Program. Any commission earned from revenue that is entered into dispute by an
issuing bank or cardholder will be deducted from the account balance. </p>

<p><b>PAYOUTS</b></p>
<p>Pay periods run from the 1<sup>st</sup> through the 15<sup>th</sup>
and from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the end of each calendar month. Payouts are
calculated and are due to be cut 5 business days from the close of the previous
pay period. Payouts are made semi-monthly and occur bi-weekly on average. </p>

<p>If an account is flagged for suspicious or fraudulent
activity payments may be held until an investigation can be completed and a
resolution can be determined. Investigations are typically resolved in 2 weeks
but can take up to 30 days. During that time any residual sales will be
calculated and added to the pending commission on hold. At the conclusion
pending commissions will either be released at the close of the following pay
period or removed at the time of account termination depending on the result of
the investigation.</p>

<p><b>TAX POLICY</b></p>
<p>All participants of the Program that are subject to U.S.
taxes are responsible to report their earnings to the IRS. If your physical
address on file with the Program is based within the United States we are
